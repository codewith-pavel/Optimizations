# Skin Cancer Diagnosis using Hybrid Multistage Knowledge Distillation and Explainable AI

This repository contains the code, models, and experimental results for our research on improving skin cancer diagnosis using a **hybrid model-driven multistage knowledge distillation (MSKD)** framework, enhanced by **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods and additional optimization strategies.

## 📘 Paper Title

**Leveraging Hybrid Model-Driven Multistage Knowledge Distillation with Explainable AI and Further Optimization for Skin Cancer Diagnosis**

## 📄 Abstract

Skin cancer is one of the most rapidly growing cancers worldwide. Our proposed approach introduces a hybrid model that fuses CNN and Transformer-based teacher models, and distills their knowledge into an efficient student model through multistage knowledge distillation. To enhance clinical trust, we integrate Explainable AI methods like **GRAD-CAM**, **LIME**, and **SHAP**. Furthermore, we employ advanced optimization techniques such as learning rate scheduling, dropout regularization, and focal loss to boost performance. The experimental results on benchmark skin lesion datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- ✅ **Hybrid Teacher Architecture**: Combines CNN (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet) and Transformer (e.g., ViT, Swin) based models.
- ✅ **Multistage Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers feature-level and logit-level knowledge in a staged manner.
- ✅ **Student Model Optimization**: Lightweight model designed for deployment with minimal performance trade-off.
- ✅ **Explainable AI Integration**: GRAD-CAM, LIME, SHAP visualizations for model interpretability.
- ✅ **Extensive Evaluation**: On skin cancer datasets such as ISIC and HAM10000.

## 🧰 Methodology Overview

1. **Teacher Models**: Ensemble of pretrained CNNs and Vision Transformers.
2. **Distillation Strategy**:
   - Stage 1: Feature-level distillation from each teacher.
   - Stage 2: Logit-level ensemble distillation.
3. **Student Model**: Compact CNN trained on combined distillation losses.
4. **XAI Methods**: Used for visual explanation and trustworthiness.
5. **Optimization**: Adaptive learning rate, Focal Loss, Dropout, Batch Normalization.
